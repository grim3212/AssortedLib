/**
 * Brings a client up to date whenever it loads new data into a block entity (a sync packet and an
 * update tag both end in {@code loadWithComponents}): an {@link IBlockEntityWithModelData} is
 * re-rendered, and an {@link IBlockLightEmission} block is relit. Neither loader does either - model
 * data is only read at the section's next rebuild, and light is only recomputed where a block state
 * changed - so a block whose look or light lives in its block entity changed only for the player who
 * changed it.
